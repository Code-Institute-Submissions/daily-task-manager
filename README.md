# DAILY - The Task Manager.

DAILY is a valuable tool for people looking to stay organized and maximize their productivity. With its user-friendly interface and intuitive features, it empowers users to take control of their tasks and optimize their workflow.

## Project Scope

For my third portfolio project at [Code Institue's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Fullstack Software Development Program, I was tasked with developing a terminal application in Python. Given the opportunity to create a program with real-world utility, I decided to develop a Task Manager.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create new tasks.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all my tasks to get an overview of my tasks.
- As a user, I want to be able to update the status between Open, in Progress and Completed.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete tasks that are completed or no longer relevant.
- As a user, I want to be able to exit the program when I have finished working.
- As a user, I want to be able to specify the date I want my task to be finished.
- As a user, I want to receive an error message when entering invalid data.

After starting the program, users are greeted with the main menu, where they receive a warm welcome and a brief introduction to the app's features. The menu presents several options, and users must make a selection by entering the corresponding number and pressing Enter.
